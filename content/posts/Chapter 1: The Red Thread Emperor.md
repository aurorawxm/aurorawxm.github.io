Chapter 1: The Red Thread Emperor

On a moonlit night in the twelfth year of the prosperous reign of Emperor Ming Sheng of the Great Qi Dynasty, the Emperor had a dream. The God of Marriage appeared in his dream and presented him with a red thread of destiny. The imperial attendants, upon hearing this, exchanged glances and exclaimed, "Congratulations, Your Majesty! It seems the immortal intends to bless you with another auspicious union!" These words scratched an itch in Emperor Ming Sheng's heart, making him feel delighted from head to toe. He couldn't sleep for the rest of the night, and in the morning, he eagerly took out a specially made marriage book called "The Mandarin Duck Registry," which he updated annually. It contained detailed information about suitable marriage candidates, including portraits, family backgrounds, and temperaments. It was even more comprehensive than the data held by the matchmakers in the capital.

The two attendants exchanged a glance, and one of them moved the candle closer to Emperor Ming Sheng, while the other handed him a calligraphy brush. They wondered which lucky young man or lady would be "honored" with Emperor Ming Sheng's royal marriage. Yes, Emperor Ming Sheng had a passion for playing matchmaker. The people of Qi wondered why an emperor would enjoy arranging marriages, and after extensive research, they concluded that it must be hereditary. Emperor Ming Sheng's mother, Empress Dowager Duanhui, was a renowned matchmaker in the region before she entered the palace. She successfully sold herself as a beloved consort to the previous emperor, who was widely known for his romantic escapades. Her extraordinary achievement became the epitome of all matchmakers in the world. What good was it to be skilled in matchmaking if it couldn't compare to becoming a consort oneself? Emperor Ming Sheng was her own flesh and blood, so how could he not enjoy playing matchmaker... I mean, tying the red thread of destiny! Over the years, with the competent Prime Minister within the kingdom and the capable Prince guarding the northern borders, Emperor Ming Sheng could comfortably focus on being a peaceful monarch while caring about his officials' marriage matters. Thanks to his efforts, the Qi court set an unprecedented record of having no bachelors, and the common people affectionately referred to him as the "Red Thread Emperor."

However, the attendants who served Emperor Ming Sheng were always on edge whenever he arranged a marriage. They feared that this "Red Thread Emperor" might mistakenly tie the wrong red thread and ruin the reputation and dignity of their sovereign. But Emperor Ming Sheng seemed to have a natural talent for this task. Over the years, the attendants witnessed him walking the tightrope without a single misstep. Every match he made resulted in loving and affectionate couples who lived happily together. It was truly a blessing from the heavens. Emperor Ming Sheng, engrossed in flipping through "The Mandarin Duck Registry," had no idea that he would soon face a major setback in his non-professional career.

He realized that a marriage he had promised a decade ago was now due, as the prospective bride and groom had both come of age. Without hesitation, he made a bold decision to grant his divine blessing to these two fortunate individuals. Seizing the opportunity, he set the wedding date for the next year's Qixi Festival, a highly auspicious day. Emperor Ming Sheng felt exceptionally wise. The two eunuchs carrying out the imperial edicts departed on horseback—one headed south towards the capital, and the other southwest beyond the capital—to deliver the auspicious gifts to the lucky pair of geese.

However, these two "lucky geese" did not feel lucky at all. On the receiving end,
